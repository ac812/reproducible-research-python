### Code Cells
You can write your Python code in **code cells** in your Notebook.   
To create a code cell:  
1. Choose **Code** from the dropdown menu that contains the type of cells for the Notebook in the notebook toolbar.  
![](images/code-cell-dd.png)
2. Click on the **Add Code Cell Below** button![](images/add-cell.png) button on the notebook toolbar in 
PyCharm. 
3. A cell will be created. You can now start writing your Python code inside the code cell.
4. As before, to run the code cell, click on the **Run Cell and Select below** ![](images/run-cell.png) button in the notebook toolbar to run the code in that cell only, or **Run All** ![](images/run-all.png) button to run all the cells of the Notebook.

Below is an example of how a code cell and its output after running the code cell will look in your Notebook.

## Sharing 
Once you have finished writing your Notebook, go to the location where you have your PyCharm Project and you should be 
able to see your Notebook file/s (`.ipynb`) in that folder. You can send the .ipynb file to someone or upload it to a 
drive for example. If you have created folders with data in your project that are used in the `.ipynb` file, than make 
sure to also send the whole project folder that contains the folder with the data and the `.ipynb` file it, so that the functions that 
use that data are not disrupted in your code.  
**Make sure that you have saved your code and have run the Notebook successfully before sending or submitting it!**

This [link](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki) contains different examples of Jupyter Notebooks for you to explore. Look into a few Notebooks and check 
the .ipynb files to see how others are displaying content in Notebooks..
