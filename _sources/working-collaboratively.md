# Working collaboratively

When you are working on someone else's repository, you would need to first **fork** the repository, *i.e.,* make a copy
of someone else's repository into your GitHub account so that you now have the same repository present in your list of
repositories. You will not be able to make changes directly on someone else's repository unless you are a collaborator
in that repository. You will then need to follow the GitHub flow process. The example below, provides you with a
step-by-step example of how two people worked together collaboratively on GitHub.

In this exercise, we will be looking at an example of how two people can work collaboratively on GitHub on the same
project. In groups of two, go over the example, one of you will take the role of the Developer and the other taking the
role of the Maintainer. In the example, the Developer wants to change the GitHub.txt file present in the repository of
the Maintainer. See how they can do this, using the GitHub flow.

Please follow the step-by-step example below of two users working collaboratively on GitHub.  Please click on the forward arrows to go through the
instructions one step at a time. Click on the three vertical dots to enter in full screen mode to see the slides better.

Referring again to the [GitHub flow diagram](fig-github-flow), reflect how the steps you have made together map to
the different steps of the GitHub flow process. The GitHub flow is the process used as a good practice when working
collaboratively. It might feel a bit complex if this is your first time doing this, but the more you practice the more
it will get easier.
