# Creating issues

In the previous example we have learnt how to create a repository and a file. One feature that is very useful in GitHub
to help in the project management of your code are issues. **Issues** are created to suggest an idea, improvements or
keep track of bugs, in other words, it can be viewed as a task list for the project. Issues are very useful especially
when working collaboratively. They are very simple to use and are often ways to have a discussion between collaborators
on a particular issue.

```{exercise-start} Creating an issue
:label: exercise-issue
```
**Level:** {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`

In this example we will learn how to create an issue in GitHub and add a label to it to categorise it appropriately (for example;
bug, enhancement, help wanted, etc...).

Please follow the step-by-step instructions on how to create an issue on GitHub below.  Please click on the forward arrows to go through the
instructions one step at a time. Click on the three vertical dots to enter in full screen mode to see the slides better.
