# Code Cells
You can write your Python code in **code cells** in your Notebook.   

To create a code cell:  
1. Click on the **+Code** button ![colab-code](images/colab-code.png) from the top right-hand-side notebook toolbar. 
2. A code cell will be created. You can now start writing your Python code inside the code cell.
4. As before, to run the code cell, click on Play icon ![colab-play](images/colab-play.png) in the left gutter of the cell 
to get the output of the code displayed underneath the code cell.

Below is an example of how a code cell and its output after running the code cell will look in your Notebook.

## Sharing 
On Google Drive, if you go to the location where you have saved your notebook, you should be ble to see your Notebook 
file/s (`.ipynb`) in that folder. You can send the `.ipynb` file to someone or share it directly with others via Google Drive 
using the Share button at the top right-hand-side of the Colab document.  You can also get a link from there and use the link
to share it with your collaborators.

This [link](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki) contains different examples of Jupyter Notebooks for you to explore. Look into a few Notebooks and check 
the .ipynb files to see how others are displaying content in Notebooks.
