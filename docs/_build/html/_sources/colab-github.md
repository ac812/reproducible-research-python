# Colab/Pycharm to GitHub

In the previous sections, we have edited a text file directly on GitHub.  It is not always feasible to work directly on GitHub.
In this section, we will be looking at keeping our files updated on GitHub by using Colaboratory and Pycharm directly.  This 
allows one to code and run their project on their favourite tool, while also making sure that their files are saved on GitHub.
Integrating this process as part of your everyday work when coding, will enable you to adopt the good practices in coding and reproducibility.

## Committing files from Pycharm to GitHub

As an IDE, Pycharm has integrated in it way to facilitate the process of keeping your files in a version control system. 
It provides more functionality than Colaboratory and it will allow you to work on more complex Python projects that would have several 
files.
