# Course Overview

````{card} 
<b>Description</b> 
</br> Fostering a culture of open research is important to enable reproducibility of results.  Scripts and code used to generate
results in research studies are normally ommitted from publication, leading to several challenges in reproducibility of 
research. In this course we will learn how to address this when coding in Python, using literate programming and version 
control. We will learn how to create Jupyter Notebooks - a way to integrate your Python analyses into reports. We will also cover 
the importance of version control when developing code.  Version control helps you write code for your research more 
sustainably and collaboratively, in line with best practices for open research. We will take you through the basic use 
of GitHub to help you store, manage, and track changes to your code and develop code collaboratively with others. 
</br> 

<b>Prerequisites</b>
</br>To be able to follow this course, learners should have knowledge in programming in Python.
</br>

<b>Learning Outcomes</b>
</br>By the end of the course, learners will be able to:
1.  explain what Jupyter Notebooks are and identify their advantages and importance in open research
2.  create Python Juypter Notebooks
3.  use Markdwon to format text in Notebooks
4.  explain what version control systems and identify their advantages and importance in open research
5.  create repositories on GitHub
6.  commit changes to files in repositories on GitHub
7.  open issues on GitHub
8.  create branches on GitHub
9.  open pull requests and merge changes into the main branch
10. describe the GitHub flow and be able to execute it
</br>

<b>Target audience</b>
</br>Designed with beginners in mind, this course caters to those who have not yet delved into Jupyter Notebooks, Git or GitHub.
