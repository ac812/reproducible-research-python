    "To add a Text cell:  \n",
    "1.  Choose the `+Text` button in the top toolbar ![colab-text](images/colab-text.png)\n",
    "2.  This will add the text cell in your Jupyter Notebook. Double-click on the cell and start typing your Markdown.  There \n",
    "    is a display panel on the right-hand-side that shows the output of your Markdown which is very helpful.\n",
